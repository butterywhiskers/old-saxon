# Old Saxon

## Purpose
This repository is for working with data in the [Old Saxon language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Saxon). I am working on creating a set of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards to learn the Old Saxon language well enough to read the main literary work produced in it, the [Heliand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliand). I am going to use [Professor Brett Kessler](https://psychweb.wustl.edu/kessler)'s work as a starting point as he has made a list of [Old Saxon words by frequency of occurrence](http://spell.psychology.wustl.edu/OS-Heliand/freqWords) in the Heliand text.

## References
I have yet to decide on a citation style, in the meantime here are some works I am using:
* Prof. Brett Kessler ["Concordance of words, by frequency."](http://spell.psychology.wustl.edu/OS-Heliand/freqWords)
* Otto Behagel ["Heliand und Genesis"](https://archive.org/stream/heliandundgenes00behagoog)
